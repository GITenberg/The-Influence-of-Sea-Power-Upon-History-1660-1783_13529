description: '"Mahan uses some detail and technical language to demonstrate particular
  naval engagements from 1660-1783, but apart from being just a lecturer on naval
  warfare and an analyst on tactics, he demonstrates how the use of the general navies,
  or the strategy of using a strong navy to protect the fleet of an aggressive merchant
  marine, is the single most important root cause of advancing economic and therefore
  military prosperity in any nation. Using Great Britain as his main example, he also
  details the Dutch fleets to demonstrate their reason for becoming a European superpower
  in their own right. Later he identifies the presence of the French navy, apart from
  any material success in its engagements, as one of the determining reasons why America
  had a chance to win its independence. Finally, as he hints of the supreme commercial
  and military importance of the proposed (Panama) canal, against the declining state
  of the American navy and the paltry condition of its merchant fleet, he urges that
  Americas prosperity if not survival depends on the powerful revival of its sea power."
